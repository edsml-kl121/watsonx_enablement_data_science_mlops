# **WatsonX Enablement: Data Science and MLOps**

## **Overview**
This repository contains the materials and lab exercises designed to enable students to learn **WatsonX** with a focus on **Data Science** and **MLOps**. It includes various labs that guide the students through different aspects of watsonx, from data visualization and connection to deployment and monitoring.


## **Instructions**
1. **Main Focus**: 
   - Start by setting up your environment using the **Lab_0_setup_instructions/main_route/LAB 0 - Logging in & Setting up with student ID.pdf** file.
   - follow through the guide in **Lab_1_data_visualization_and_connection/Lab_1_data_visualization_and_connection.pdf**
   - follow through the guide in **Lab_2_auto_ai_deployment/LAB_2_Auto_ai_deployment.pdf** and **/Lab_3_watson_studio_deployment/pandas** folder
   - **Lab 5** (pipeline MLOps).
   
2. **Homework**: 
   - Labs 3 (spark) & Lab 4 are assigned as homework.

## **Folder Structure**

- **Lab_0_setup_instructions**: Instructions for setting up the environment, including student login setup. This lab is critical for getting started and ensures you are ready for the subsequent exercises.
  
- **main_route**: **This is the focus of the course.** This folder contains core exercises that students need to complete as part of the hands-on labs around setting up & logging in. It provides a guided pathway for watsonx DataSci & MLOps training.

- **Lab_1_data_visualization_and_connection**: Learn how to import & visualize data and connect to watsonx services.

- **Lab_2_auto_ai_deployment**: Dive into AutoAI deployment, where you will explore automating model development workflows.

- **Lab_3_watson_studio_deployment**: Learn how to deploy models using Watson Studio, focusing on pandas and Spark environments.

- **Lab_4_monitoring**: **Focus on no-code solutions**. This lab is crucial as it introduces monitoring ML models in a production environment without requiring extensive coding. It covers:
  - **No-Code Monitoring**: Tools and interfaces that allow non-technical users to track and monitor models.
  - **Code (Optional)**: For more advanced users who want to dig deeper into programmatic monitoring.

- **Lab_5_watson_pipeline_mlops**: **This lab is mandatory**. It teaches students to build and manage pipelines using watson MLOps tools. The instructions are in the `Lab_5_watson_pipeline_instructions.pdf`, and it focuses on integrating monitoring, automation, and governance in your ML pipelines.
